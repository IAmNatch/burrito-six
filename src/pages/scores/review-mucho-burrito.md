  Although Dani Subject says beef is the hardest food to get food poisoning
  from, this is in fact not true. Ground beef, due to it's large surface area
  has the highest potential for the contraction of bacteria during preparation.
  Dis is bad. 


  We didn't get food poisoning from it, but we spent a lot of time talking about
  it. You decide what that means.
