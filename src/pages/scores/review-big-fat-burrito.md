  This is the holy grail of non bougy burritos. They use dope ass ingredients.
  They load that shit up without overfilling it. They're steak is real steak.
  Fuck yea.

  Imagine you're walking through Kensington market. You're on the hunt for good
  shit. What do you do? You walk into Big Fat Burrito (Not to be confused with
  the notorious "Fat Bastards") and grab yourself a dank ass eat. It's gonna be
  good.
